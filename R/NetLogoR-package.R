#' for editing:
#'
#' ```r
#' exPath <- file.path(system.file(package = "NetLogoR", "examples")
#' file.edit(exPath, "Ants", "Ants.R"))
#' file.edit(exPath, "Butterfly", "Butterfly-1.R"))
#' file.edit(exPath, "Wolf-Sheep-Predation", "Wolf-Sheep-Predation.R"))

#' Internal CRS usage
#'
#' This is used in various places when converting `agentMatrix` objects to
#' `SpatialPoints` for use with functions, such as `raster::buffer()`.
#' None of these functions results in any real geospatial information being conserved,
#' other than distance and angle  calculations. Buffering still occurs on the
#' unit-less World. This is therefore a way to allow `sp` and `raster`
#' functions to work *as if a cell in the World was equal to 1 m*. The resulting
#' answers will be converted back to units of "cells", not "m".
#' The `CRS()` operation is relatively time consuming.
#' Having a single object usable throughout is *much* faster.

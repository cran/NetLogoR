## A Port of NetLogo Functions and Language to R

Easily create agent-based models in R following the NetLogo framework ([Wilensky, 1999](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)).
`NetLogoR` provides classes to represent "patches" (raster cells) and "turtles" (moving individuals), functions reproducing the necessary [NetLogo primitives](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html) as well as new complementary functions to easily build agent-based models or translate NetLogo models in R.

## Getting Started

A programming guide inspired from the [NetLogo Programming Guide](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html) and a dictionary of [NetLogo primitives](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html) equivalences are available.
As examples, three NetLogo models ([Ants](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Ants), Butterfly (Railsback and Grimm, 2012) and [Wolf-Sheep-Predation](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/WolfSheepPredation)) were translated to R using `NetLogoR`.

## Installing `NetLogoR`

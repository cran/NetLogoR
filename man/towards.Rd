\usage{
towards(agents, agents2, world, torus = FALSE)

\S4method{towards}{matrix,matrix}(agents, agents2, world, torus = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{agents}{Matrix (\code{ncol} = 2) with the first column \code{pxcor} and the second
column \code{pycor} representing the \code{patches} coordinates, or

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{          `AgentMatrix` object representing the moving `agents`.
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}}

\item{agents2}{Matrix (\code{ncol} = 2) with the first column \code{pxcor} and the second
column \code{pycor} representing the \code{patches} coordinates, or

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{           `AgentMatrix` object representing the moving `agents`, or

           Matrix (`ncol` = 2) with the first column `x` and the second column
           `y` representing locations coordinates.
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}}

\item{world}{\code{WorldMatrix} or \code{worldArray} object.}

\item{torus}{Logical to determine if the \code{world} is wrapped. Default is
\code{torus = FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Numeric. Vector of angles in degrees of length equal to the largest
number of agents/locations between \code{agents} and \code{agents2}.
}
\description{
Report the directions of each \code{agents} towards each corresponding \code{agents2}.
}
\details{
\code{agents} and \code{agents2} must have the same number of agents/locations
or if different, one of them must have only one agent/location. If
\code{agents} and \code{agents2} have the same number of agents/locations,
the directions are calculated for each pair \code{agents[i]} and \code{agents2[i]}
and not for each \code{agents} towards every single \code{agents2}.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{     If `torus = FALSE`, `world` does not need to be provided.

     If `torus = TRUE` and the distance from one `agents` to
     its corresponding `agents2` is smaller around the
     sides of the `world` than across it, then the direction to `agents2`
     going around the sides of the `world` is returned.

     The direction from a patch to its location returns 0; the direction from
     a turtle to its location returns the turtle's heading.

\examples{
w1 <- createWorld(minPxcor = 0, maxPxcor = 4, minPycor = 0, maxPycor = 4)
towards(agents = patches(w1), agents2 = cbind(x = 0, y = 0))
t1 <- createTurtles(n = 10, world = w1)
towards(agents = t1, agents2 = cbind(x = 0, y = 0))
